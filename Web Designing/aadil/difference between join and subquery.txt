difference between join and subquery--
1. whenever we require multiple result from different tables we use join,wherea subquery is mostly used fr filtering result in a same table by applying a condition which is comming from  other tables
2. join can be fast compared to subquery in scenario where join uses indexes or index column,subquery can be most costlier in scenarios where it uses co-related technique.
